Pre-history:
------------
              Internet Time  was a decimal time concept  introduced in 1998
              and marketed  by the  Swatch  corporation  as  an alternative,
              decimal  measure of time.  One of  the goals  was to simplify
              the way people in different time zones communicate about time,
              mostly by eliminating time zones altogether.
                                                               -- Wikipedia

Several years ago I used to work for an international research company. This
company had people from all over the world.  I know from personal experience
how hard it is to set up a proper time for a company-wide conference call
with many participants living in different time zones.

When I first heard about the Internet Time concept, I was hit by the idea of
the global common time. As a computer programmer, with binaries in mind, and
a person from the part of humanity that uses metric system, I also was ready
to adopt the concept of decimal measure of time immediately.
